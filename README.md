# test-sentinel-libraries

This repository has been created to test the [Foundational Policy Library](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/secure-your-cloud-with-terraform-foundational-policy-library) demo.

I have used the policy from [this working directory](https://github.com/dlavric/terraform-foundational-policies-library/blob/master/cis/azure/compute/azure-cis-7.4-compute-only-approved-extensions-are-installed/azure-cis-7.4-compute-only-approved-extensions-are-installed.sentinel) of the foundational policy library.

Resources used:

- [Sentinel policies](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/policy-quickstart?in=terraform/cloud-get-started)

- [Foundational Policy Library Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library)
